Normal merge sort works faster than this " concurrent " merge sort..

FOR SAMPLE INPUT :
10000
1 2 3 ..... 10000

Time taken by Merge Sort : 0.005943
Time taken by Concurrent Merge Sort : 0.412374
Time taken by Multithreaded Merge Sort : 0.412374


therefore :
    multi threaded < normal < concurrent
